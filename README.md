>More details about the styles and patterns used in this app can be found in my [AngularJS Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide) and my **AngularJS Patterns: Clean Code**(coming soon) course at [Pluralsight](http://pluralsight.com/training/Authors/Details/john-papa) and working in teams. 


## TODO
1. Structure will have specs side by side with code, except cross cutting tests
2. Remove extraneous code unrelated to tests
3. Add ui-router
4. Revise from avengers

## Structure
	/build 	(created on the fly)
	/gulp	
	/src
		/client
			/app
			/content
			/test
		/server
			/data
			/routes
	

## Installing Node.js and Bower Packages
- Open terminal
- Type `npm install`

## Installing Bower Packages
`npm install` will install these too, but you can do it manually.
- Open terminal
- Type `bower install`

## Running
Runs locally, no database required.

### Dev Builds
The dev build does not optimize the deployed code. It simply runs it in place. You can run a dev build in multiple ways.

####Option 1 - Serve
Type `gulp serve-dev` and browse to `http://localhost:7202`

####Option 2 - Serve and Debug Node
Type `gulp serve-dev-debug` and browse to `http://localhost:7202` for the client and `http://localhost:8080/debug?port-5858` to debug the server.

####Option 3 - Serve and Debug Node Breaking on 1st Line
Type `gulp serve-dev-debug-brk` and browse to `http://localhost:7202` for the client and `http://localhost:8080/debug?port-5858` to debug the server.

### Staging Build
The staging build is an optimized build. Type `gulp serve-stage` and browse to `http://localhost:7202`

The optimizations are performed by the gulp tasks and include the following list. See the `gulpfile.js` for details

- jshint
- preparing Angular's templatecache for html templates
- concat task to bundle css and js, separately
- Angular dependency injection annotations using ngAnnotate
- uglify to minify and mangle javascript
- source maps
- css autoprefixer for vendor prefixes
- minify css
- optimize images
- index.html injection for scripts and links
- deploying all js, css, images, fonts, and index.html

## Testing
Type `gulp test` to run the tests including both unit and midway tests (spins up a server). This will create a watch on the files, with a 5 second delay, to run the tests.

Testing uses karma, mocha, chai, sinon, ngMidwayTester libraries.

## How It Works
The app is quite simple and has 2 main routes:
- dashboard
- avengers list

### The Modules
The app has 4 feature modules and depends on a series of external modules and custom but cross-app modules

```
app --> [
        app.avengers,
        app.dashboard,
        app.layout,
        app.widgets,
		app.core --> [
			ngAnimate,
			ngRoute,
			ngSanitize,
			blocks.exception,
			blocks.logger,
			blocks.router
		]
    ]
```
